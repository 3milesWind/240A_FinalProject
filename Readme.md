CSE230 Project Proposal

# Descriptions: 

You are an adventurer. You need to set off from the castle to save the kidnapped princess. Because the situation is very urgent, you have to get there in a certain number of steps. You might meet monsters and rocks on the way. You can kill monsters and move rocks(rocks can't be destroyed), but these operations will also consume a few steps. If you fail to save the princess before using up all the steps, then you lose, otherwise you win. 

In the game, there will be four elements: adventurer(you), princess, monster and rocks. 

### Adventurer:
When the game starts, the adventurer can start to move. Each time, it can only move one step. 

### Princess:
When the game starts, the princess will be some place in the game. It will never move. All it can do is to wait for adventurer

As for Monster and Rock, when they are not by the wall, the adventurer can push them forward one square with the cost of one step. When they are by the wall, the wall will prevent the adventurer from continuing to push them forward. However, in this kind of situation, the adventurer can kill the Monster(the Rock can not be destroyed).
